# Multicolor design to 3DPrint a Rainbow with clouds

This project was my response to the challenge by [3D printing Nerd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quFqjUUYN6E).

The history of the master branch shows the step-by-step progress of improvement of the design.
The final variation includes the customization, so it can be used directly on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3100539).

1. There are different ways to create solids in OpenSCAD. For rainbow let's start with rectangular
cross-section
2. Move the cross-section into distance from the Z-axes
